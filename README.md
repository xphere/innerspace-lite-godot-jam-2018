Innerspace Lite

Go into the shrink beam with your spaceship so you can enter a pacient's brain and destroy the invasion of freezers and heaters before the fever causes havoc!

This is a tribute to the film Innerspace and the videogame Asteroids, mixed with the Godot Jam 2018 theme of Temperature.

I hope you enjoy it as much as I did coding it!

Thx to Godot maintainers for such a nice engine!
